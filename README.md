# Opinion Roulette 🎲
### Where Your Hot Takes Get Roasted by the World

Welcome to **Opinion Roulette**—the global polling site where your most questionable life choices meet the brutal honesty of internet strangers. Ever wondered if people think pineapple on pizza is a crime? Or if texting your ex is worse than liking your crush's ancient photo? Yeah, us too. And now, the world will judge you for it. Publicly. Mercilessly.

## 🤔 What Is This Madness?
A beautifully chaotic space where we ask the real hard-hitting questions like:
- *Is cereal a soup?* (Spoiler: It's not, but okay.)
- *Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?* (We won’t judge your answer... but the duck might.)
- *Which came first: the chicken or the egg?* (Still unsolved. Scientists are crying.)

## 🚀 Features
- **Binary Choices:** No "it depends" here. Pick a side and own it.
- **Instant Regret:** See how your answers stack up against the world's. Warning: May cause existential dread.
- **Global Roast:** Participate in the collective judgment of humanity’s worst and best opinions.
- **Sassy UI:** Bright colors, sarcastic tooltips, and zero hand-holding.

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Open the site.
2. Read the question (try not to overthink it).
3. Pick an answer.
4. Feel validated... or personally attacked.
5. Repeat.

## 💡 Sample Questions
- Would you rather **forget your anniversary** or **your partner’s birthday**? (Good luck.)
- Is a **hotdog** a sandwich? (Prepare for heated debates.)
- Would you rather **text your ex** or **like your crush’s 5-year-old post**? (There's no right answer.)

## 🙃 Why This Exists
Because the internet needed more places for people to argue over dumb things. And honestly, why not?

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (because we’re fancy like that)
- **Backend:** You don’t need to know, just trust us
- **Global Judgement:** Powered by collective internet wisdom
